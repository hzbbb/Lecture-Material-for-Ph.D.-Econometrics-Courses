# Lecture-Material-for-Ph.D.-Econometrics-Courses
This is a folder for all materials used in my lectures for Ph.D. level Econometrics courses in the Department of Economics, University of Rochester. Including ECON 484 and ECON 485.
There are five folders.
The first folder is for the book Introduction to Statistics and Econometrics, written by Amemiya. This book is usually used as the introductory material for graduate students before they start to learn econometrics.
The second folder is for the book Econometrics, written by Bruce Hansen (based on 2015 edition). This is a book focusing more on cross-sectional and panel data, with i.i.d. assumption as the foundation in most of the part.
The third folder is for the book Econometrics, written by Fumio Hayashi. This book considers more about time-series data without i.i.d. assumption.
The fourth folder includes materials I covered for some introductory level special topics in Econometrics including Discrete Choice Model, BLP Method, Basic Non-parametric Kernel Method and Machine Learning Method.
The fifth folder includes all contents for an introductory course of using data analysis software STATA. 
If you find any mistakes in the notes, please contact me. Thanks!
